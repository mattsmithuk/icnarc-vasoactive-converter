## ICNARC Vasoactive Drug Converter

This project provides a single-file HTML tool (`icnarc-vasoactive-converter.html`) to convert intravenous infusion rates (ml/hr) into weight-based doses for critical care drugs. It is designed to assist staff in preparing data for input into the ICNARC Case Mix Programme (CMP).

### Features
- **Web-based, single HTML file**: No installation or dependencies required. Open directly in any modern web browser.
- **User-friendly interface**: Enter patient weight and infusion rates for a range of vasoactive drugs.
- **Automatic calculations**: Instantly converts ml/hr rates to standardised weight-based units (e.g., Âµg/kg/min, mg/hr, U/min) as required by ICNARC CMP.
- **Clear button**: Quickly reset all fields and results.
- **Visual warnings**: Prompts for missing weight input.
- **Responsive design**: Usable on desktop and mobile devices.

### Usage
1. Open `icnarc-vasoactive-converter.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter the patient's actual body weight (kg).
3. Enter the infusion rate (ml/hr) for each drug as required.
4. The tool will automatically display the corresponding weight-based dose for each drug.
5. Use the "Clear" button to reset all fields.

### Purpose
This tool streamlines the process of converting bedside infusion rates into the standardised units required for ICNARC CMP data entry, reducing calculation errors and saving time for critical care staff.
